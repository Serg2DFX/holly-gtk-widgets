_New widget:_ *HIpTextBox*
  # an Entry customized for ip addresses in multiple formats ( ipv4 ipv6 etc )

  # a simpler version of [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/grid/csharpgridcontrol.aspx SourceGrid], or the XPTable, or a swt-table like widget.  Still thinking.

Feature plans:
  * study databinding in winforms, maibe do something similar for gtk widgets
  * some refactoring in the widgets events name
  * rebuild HFontPicker to be an extended HSimpleComboBox
  * make a nicer analog clock :) Nice example [http://wwww.vgdotnet.com/blog/shiny_clock.png here]
