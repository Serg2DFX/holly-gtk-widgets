_New widget:_ *HGridView*
  # a simpler version of [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/grid/csharpgridcontrol.aspx SourceGrid], or the XPTable, or a swt-table like widget.  Still thinking. [http://www.telerik.com/products/winforms/controls/gridview/overview.aspx This] is nice also...

  * rebuild HFontPicker to be an extended HSimpleComboBox - also add a nice icon to each font - and maibe do the picker to be like the abiword's one ( it would load faster )
  * verify if i have rights to create a new folder on the HComboFolder widget
  * study data binding in winforms, maybe do something similar for gtk widgets
  * remove any cairo binding - use only System.Drawing ( it's really faster )
  * make a nicer analog clock :) Nice example [http://wwww.vgdotnet.com/blog/shiny_clock.png here]

_New widget:_ *HSchedulingCalendar*
  # a nice calendar widget with scheduling features
